It is a non-profit project which may be later monetized using any Ad platform. 

## Tech Stack
The tech stack will consist of these technologies:
Node.js - Backend REST API
MongoDB - Database instances
Angular / React - Front End components.
HTML5/Bootstrap

## User website
After some primary research it was decided that the user-facing website will be done in Bootstrap 3 or 4 because of the following reasons:

Provides Enough customization - All bootstrap donâ€™t look like the same. From bootstrap 3 onwards, it allows a lot of customization when most of the grid system and other essential things are still built in.

Fast and easy to use - Bootstrap is fast and easy to use. It's a part of most package managers like npm and bower.
